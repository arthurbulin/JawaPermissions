ChangeLog:
    0.5.4a:
        new:
          - Ranks are now treated as java objects that contain all rank permissions/prohibitions per every existing world and are used to evaluate within rank object
          - Increased performance; hasPermission checks no longer iterate and will add long perms to the list internally when wildcards are specified
        todos:
          - cleanup old variables and methods
          - comments in code are gross right now
          - JavaDoc is also pretty bad
        known_bugs:
          - immunity won't work as is. New rank object system hasn't been wired for it yet
          - perm reload won't work yet. it will be redone so that objects are reused and not discarded to save on GC.
    0.3.1a:
        - Permissions adjusted to use bukkit's internal configuration loading to parse yml instead
    0.2.5a:
        - Initial Operational version.
